                <div className="py-5 text-[15px]">The majority of our work is conducted outside of standard working hours, such as large LAN/WAN migrations for High Street retailers. However, our reputation also stems from our ability to provide engineers at short notice, sometimes within a 12-hour timeframe, for ad hoc jobs. These assignments require skilled and trained engineers with transportation, appropriate personal protective equipment{`(PPE)`} , and a deep understanding of networking.

                    Candidates must operate as self-employed, within a limited company {`(LTD)`}, or under an umbrella company. If an umbrella arrangement is required, we can facilitate this through our partner.</div>
